# <center>Short Bio</center>

I recently completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Srikanta Bedathur](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/) and Prof. [Prem Kumar Kalra](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~pkalra/) at the Amar Nath and Shashi Khosla School of Information Technology at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in).


Research Interests:

   **1. Multimodal Learning - Vision Language Modes**
   **1. Generative AI - Code LLMs, VLMs**   
   **1. Topological Deep Learning**   
   **2. Copmuter Vision**   
   **3. Point Clouds**   
   **4. Graphs**
 <br>
Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Associate in the [Machine learning Group](https://mllab.csa.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore advised by Prof. [Chiranjib Bhattacharyya]([http://iitg.ernet.in/cse](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/chiranjib-bhattacharyya/)). Even before, I was a Master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).

**1. Calibration of Image retrieval systems for queries with ambiguous negations (with Prof. [Srikanta Bedathur](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srikanta/)  
        * Ambiguous queries - especially multiple negation are challenging for retrieval systems.  
        * Calibration of retrieval outcomes  to balance multiple alternative outcomes as equally likely.**

**2. Topological Alignment of VLMs and 3D foundation models with the real world  
        *  Study of topological correctness of VLM-generated images and 3D foundation models generated point clouds, w.r.t the real world.  
        *  Use topologically invariant properties to align these foundation models to a realistic representation of the world.**

**3. Investigating the use of Code-LLMs to solve NP-hard combinatorial problems  
         *  Neural approaches require large amounts of ground truth data, which is NP-hard to compute, operate as black boxes offering limited interpretability. and also lack cross-domain generalization.  
         *  Design self-evolutionalry approaches for generating programs to solve NP-hard problems including end-to-end interpretability with grund truth supervision.  
         *  Optimizing the order of LLM calls and balancing use of queries**

**2. Unsupervised User-persona groups discovery using Reinforcement Learning Based Human Feedback (with Prof. [Sayan Ranu]((http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/)))  
        * Unsupervised persona identification for e-commerce platforms.  
        * Develop a RLHF reward model to learn implicit persona information via conformal product/category/super-category/subcategory pair agreement.**
